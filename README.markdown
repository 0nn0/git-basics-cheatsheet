It is noted that people usually exclude dependency caches, such as `node_modules`, system files, such as `.DS_Store`, among others.

You can see the `.gitignore` file of [this repository](https://github.com/0nn0/git-basics-cheatsheet/blob/master/.gitignore) or [more examples](https://github.com/github/gitignore) provided by GitHub.
